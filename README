This is a work in progress All-In-One Calculator.
It is meant to be able to handle anything from basic arithmetic to solving algrebraic equations and matrix calculations.

TODO:
- Translate numbers in given string equation into doubles to perform operations on.
- Perform basic operations according to Order of Operations (PEMDAS)

BUGS:
- input string will read multiple '.' in same token
	- ex: ("2.1.4" is one token)
- print_num()
	- when reading "." as a double, it equals 0.0
	- but when printing the double array, it is not supposed to print indices with value 0
		- it does print the index anyway
